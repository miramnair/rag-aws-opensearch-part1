What will we achieve in Part 1?

We successfully created an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collection and a vector index within that collection. Additionally, we uploaded a sample JSON file into our S3 bucket. Currently, these components exist as separate entities. In Part 2, we will create a Bedrock agent and a knowledge base and integrate them with OpenSearch Serverless.
